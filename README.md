# Pyramid Maker

Interactive tool to create climbing volumes and calculate the necessary angles at which to cut the plyboard.

Inspired by the [following video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2mkK2qPTc), but meant to allow arbitrary (convex?) polygons as a base.

# Todo:

- [x] basic framework, rough visualization.
- [ ] create front- and sideviews.
- [ ] draw corners, highlight tip in red.
- [ ] add input boxes for parameters.
- [ ] calculate angles.
- [ ] generalize pyramid base shape, re-work types.
- [ ] randomization button.
- [ ] properly scale visualization to fill svg canvas.
- [ ] annotate visualization with angles and lengths.
- [ ] visualization with material thickness.
- [ ] compile and visualize cut list, calculate m<sup>2</sup> of material required.
- [ ] build instructions in README.
- [ ] sanity checks and warnings for steep angles etc.
- [ ] mouse interactions, dragging of corners.
- [ ] hole placement for T-Nuts.
- [ ] export cut list svg as .jpg or .pdf.
- [ ] isometric 3D visualization.
